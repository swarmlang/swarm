# swarm

Swarm is the distributed-computing-native DSL for our project.

For now, this repo contains `swarmc`, the compiler for the Swarm language.

## Building

To build a normal version, run `make`. This outputs a `swarmc` executable.

To build a version with debug output enabled, run `make debug`. This outputs a `swarmc_debug` executable.
