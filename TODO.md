- setup docker container for builds
- fix memory leaks
  - Type objects and semantic symbols
- not dogshit test suite
  - fuzzy testing with American Fuzzy Lop
- ability to call external bindings from vm
- module system / import system
- Implement IStorageInterface, IQueue, IQueueJob, and IGlobalServices
    - Redis implementation
    - pthread implementation
    - single-threaded implementation
    - ...others?
- pass to convert AST to ISA
- ast optimization pass
  - removing statements coming after a return
  - simplification of trivial expressions
- assembly optimization pass
  - `X += -Y` can be optimized in the assembly
  - Remove instructions assigning variables to themselves
  - Propagate primitives values
  - Dead code elimination
  - beginfn followed by return0
- VM runtime
- remove RESOURCE type from lexing (added so I could test WITH statements)
- Serialize ISA to SVI code
- change map access back to [] (check for lval type in name analysis to avoid parsing conflict)
- some form of exception/error system (e.g. exceptions, error values, ...?)
- FUTURE: separate fetch/execute/writeback threads for runtime
- Support Position annotations in SVI for better error messages from the VM
- Garbage collection / reference counting
- More generic logging class that can centralize logs from workers?
- More compact binary form of SVI
- `mapvalues` instruction? Parallel to `mapkeys`.
- Currently, `typeof` only works when a variable has a value stored in it
  - This means the following will fail:
    ```txt
    typify $l:a p:NUMBER
    typeof $l:a
    ```
  - Do we care to support this?
- Well-defined C++/native bridge to allow custom `f:XXX` function bindings, as well as custom stream implementations.
