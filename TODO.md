- setup docker container for builds
- fix memory leaks
- types as values
- not dogshit test suite
  - fuzzy testing with American Fuzzy
- ability to call external bindings from vm
- module system / import system
- write queue / store interfaces
    - Redis implementation
    - pthread implementation
    - ...others?
- pass to convert AST to ISA
- ast optimization pass
- assembly optimization pass
  - `X += -Y` can be optimized in the assembly
- VM runtime
- remove RESOURCE type from lexing (added so I could test WITH statements)
- Serialize ISA to SVI code
- change map access back to [] (check for lval type in name analysis to avoid parsing conflict)
- some form of exception/error system (e.g. exceptions, error values, ...?)
- FUTURE: separate fetch/execute/writeback threads for runtime
- Support Position annotations in SVI for better error messages from the VM
- Garbage collection / reference counting
