# Debugging `swarmc`

## Binary Files
This repo contains a Node.js script which can be used to dump compiled Swarm binaries to their `binn` representation for debugging.

To use it, all you need is a reasonably modern version of Node and the compiled binary:

```shell
./bin/binary_dump.js ./path/to/my/compiled.sbi
```
