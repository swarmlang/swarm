# The CLA
All contributors to the Swarm project must sign the Contributor License Agreement
which licenses their contribution under the terms of Swarm's `LICENSE` copyright
statement and assigns copyright for contributions to the Swarm project itself.

## Why?
The CLA ensures that anyone using or modifying Swarm has the right to use and
modify _all_ of the code in the Swarm codebase and protects future users &
contributors from copyright claims.

The terms of the Swarm license also provide protections for contributors with regard
to warranty and use of the code they contribute.

## How?
In this directory, there is a CLA.pdf file. Print this, sign it, and commit it to the
`signed-cla` directory with the name `CLA-{first name}-{last name}.pdf`.

Include this file with your first pull request to this project.
